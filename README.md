# SoundWave

SoundWave aims to make meaningful connections easily though shared music taste.

Users (college students) can do a variety of activites: Create a profile where you can customize and display your top songs/artists/concerts/etc. -- Post on a variety of topic-based music message boards -- Find friends on campus with other students who share your music taste! 


Python program connected to a mysql database, with a python front end.

Later, I will create and finalize class diagrams, user journey, ERD, market analysis, architecture pattern and design. I also eventually want to change the DB to GraphQL and have a working API.
